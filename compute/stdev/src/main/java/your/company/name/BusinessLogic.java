/**
 * <p>A 4 step process to calculate the <i>Standard Deviation</i>.

 * <p>For steps 1 and 2 we have the option to do the work locally
 * (in this JVM) or remotely (in the Hazelcast Cloud). So we do
 * it both ways.
 * </p>
 * <p>We use the class {@link JuniorDeveloper} for the local way,
 * to imply it's not as good. The class {@link SeniorDeveloper}
 * does the remote way, with the implication it is more sophisticated
 * and therefore better. In fact, the skill of the senior
 * developer comes in knowing what ways are available and selecting
 * the most appropriate.
 * </p>
 * <p>Neither method here is perfect. Step 3 divides by the number
 * of entries, which could be zero.
